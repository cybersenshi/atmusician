Hi, my name is Aaron - thanks for visiting my website! 

I’m a music industry professional and would love to hear from you. But first, let me tell you a bit about myself first.

(TL;DR - here’s my resume and cover letter - I’d be happy to provide your live performance and studio recording needs!)

I’ve been playing drums for 20+ years. I have also been playing pitched and unpitched percussion, piano and singing for the past 12 years.

I currently serve as a drummer/percussionist at the U.S. Air Force Band of Mid- America, where I perform in the rock, jazz, concert, and ceremonial ensembles for both live shows and recording sessions - my employment began in August 2023. Prior to that, I also served in the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division Band, where I played in the unit’s country, rock, salsa, jazz, concert, and ceremonial ensembles for a variety of live performances and studio sessions. 

Before my military musician career began in 2019, I performed on several musician contracts with professional musical theater orchestras, cruise ship orchestras, various entertainment companies, DCI groups, and other professional ensembles. I also performed in several ensembles affiliated with the School of Music during my studies at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. In May 2015, I graduated Summa Cum Laude (with a GPA of 3.765) with a bachelor’s degree in Music Education, with a concentration in percussion.  

In December of 2021 I released an album of original music in which I performed all of the drums, (pitched and un-pitched) percussion, piano/keyboards, lead and background vocals.

I also have done a lot of recording - if you need drum set, percussion, keyboard or vocal tracks for your song, I’d be happy to discuss details to provide those! 

If you’d like to hear more about me please don’t hesitate to reach out; I’d love to hear from you!

Thanks!

-Aaron
